# Claude Code Global Memory

This file is the global, cross-project "memory" for Claude Code. It defines my default preferences, policies, and guardrails. Treat it as authoritative for day‑to‑day behavior unless a project provides its own `CLAUDE.md` with overrides.

Instruction precedence (highest first):

1. The active project's local `CLAUDE.md`
2. This global file
3. External docs and examples

## Operating Assumptions

- Ask before doing anything system‑wide.
- Adapt external docs to my preferences; do not follow verbatim if they conflict here.

## Tools & Testing

### Package and Tool Management

Policy for installing and managing developer tools:

1. Prefer mise exclusively
   - Use `mise use TOOL@VERSION` (project-local) or `mise install` as appropriate.
   - Inspect `.mise.toml`/`mise.toml` first; align with pinned versions.

2. Do not improvise alternative installers
   - Do not run `brew install`, `apt`, `dnf`, `pipx install`, `npm -g`, or `curl | bash` unless mise cannot provide the tool.
   - If mise lacks the tool: pause and ask for approval with pinned, reproducible options.

3. No unsolicited upgrades or version drift
   - Never bump versions in `.mise.toml` or upgrade system packages without explicit instruction.
   - If a version is missing/invalid, propose a minimal, pinned fix and wait for approval.

4. Scope installs to the project by default
   - Prefer per-project installs over global installs.
   - If a global install is necessary, explain why and ask first.

5. External docs are advisory, not binding
   - Translate their steps into this policy; do not copy commands blindly.

### Testing Approach

- Run relevant tests before committing
- Include positive and negative test cases
- Use descriptive test names explaining the scenario

#### Test Safety & Isolation

- Always use test-safe fixtures and paths, never real system paths or program names
- Sandbox all operations with temporary directories, mock services, or isolated environments
- Use clearly fictional names: `com.example.testapp`, `fake-service`, `test-user-123`
- Tests must write to `/tmp`, `$TMPDIR`, or test directories, never real system locations
- Before running tests that modify files/settings, verify they target only test paths
- Examples of safe test data:
  - Preferences: `com.example.testapp` not `com.apple.Safari`
  - Files: `/tmp/test-output` not `~/Documents`
  - Users: `testuser` not actual usernames
  - Services: `fake-api.example.com` not real endpoints

## Execution Safety

- Preview first: use tool-specific diff/plan or `--dry-run` before applying changes
- Summarize the plan and commands before running them; group related actions
- Before executing tests, confirm they target only safe paths and use fictional data
- Never write tests or scripts that could modify real user data, preferences, or system files

## Specialized Agents

Use these specialized subagents for focused tasks:

### PR Feedback Reviewer (`pr-feedback-reviewer`)

- When to use: Addressing pull request feedback, reviewing PR comments
- Purpose: Fetches all PR comments, evaluates validity, provides prioritized recommendations
- Model: Uses Opus for thorough analysis

### Code Reviewer (`reviewer`)

- When to use: Code or document review tasks
- Purpose: Reviews code quality, architecture, and documentation
- Restrictions: Review-only agent - writes reports to scratch/ folder but doesn't modify production code

### Shell Wizard (`shell-wizard`)

- When to use: Creating or modifying shell scripts, bash scripts, installation scripts
- Purpose: Writes production-quality shell scripts with proper error handling and best practices
- Features: Safety headers, function patterns, long flags, shellcheck validation

## Comments & Communication

- Write comments explaining "why" not "what"
- Add the context missing from the code as comments
- Document non-obvious behavior and edge cases
- Include relevant links to documentation or issues
- Keep comments current with code changes

## Code Style

### Formatting

- Refer to .editorconfig if present
- Run auto formatting (`bun run format`, `cargo fmt`, `bin/rubocop -a`)
- Use indentation consistent with existing files or language conventions
- Keep lines under 80 characters when practical

### Jujutsu Commits

Use `jj desc -m "Commit message"` to describe the current change.
Use `jj new -m "Commit message"` to start a new change.

Subject: "Add a sentence case subject with no period at end"

- Subject is 50 chars max (72 absolute limit)
- Imperative mood, finishing the phrase: "This commit will..."

Body: Explain _why_ in body, wrapped at 72 chars

```gitcommit
Refactor CLAUDE.md commit message instructions

Writing commit messages that are concise, easy to understand, and well-
formatted helps users and computers understand code better.

This example makes it more likely that the agent will write good commit messages that follow best practices.

Resolves: #42
