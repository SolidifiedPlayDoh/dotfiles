# Chezmoi Configuration File Template
# This template is processed during `chezmoi init` to create the actual config file.
# Variables are prompted from the user and stored in the [data] section.

# Source Directory Configuration
# Allows us to maintain Chezmoi outside of the default `~/.local/share/chezmoi/`.
# This enables storing the dotfiles repository in a custom location while still
# using chezmoi for management. The workingTree variable points to the repo root.
sourceDir = "{{ .chezmoi.workingTree }}"

# Data Section
# Variables defined here are available in all templates via the .data namespace.
# These values can be referenced in template files throughout the dotfiles repo.
